# Deploying a Flask App to Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service with a CI/CD pipeline

## Overview
I containerized a Flask App using Docker and deployed the App to a Kubernetes cluster with a CI/CD pipeline. I associated the pipeline's one end to the Github repository (containing the application code), and connected the other end to the EKS cluster. Below is the architecture diagram of the deployed App with four main actions:
![](architecture.png)
1. Code check-in - The application code for the Flask app is hosted on Github. Multiple contributors can contribute to the repository collaboratively. 

2. Trigger Build - As soon as a commit happens in the Github repository, it will trigger the CodeBuild. This step requires connecting the Github account to the AWS CodeBuild service using a GitHub access token. Codebuld will build a new image for the application.

3. Automatic Deployment - The CodePipeline service will automatically deploy the application image to the Kubernetes cluster.

4. Service - Kubernetes cluster will start serving the application endpoints. To the end-user, there is an abstraction of the internal details of the cluster, such as nodes, PODs, containers, and the architecture.

## Flask App
The Flask app consists of a simple API with three endpoints:

- `GET '/'`: This is a simple health check, which returns the response 'Healthy'. 
- `POST '/auth'`: This takes a email and password as json arguments and returns a JWT based on a custom secret.
- `GET '/contents'`: This requires a valid JWT, and returns the un-encrpyted contents of that token. 

The app relies on a secret set as the environment variable `JWT_SECRET` to produce a JWT. The built-in Flask server is adequate for local development, but not production, so you will be using the production-ready [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) server when deploying the app.

## Dependencies
- Docker Engine
    - Installation instructions for all OSes can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
    - For Mac users, if you have no previous Docker Toolbox installation, you can install Docker Desktop for Mac. If you already have a Docker Toolbox installation, please read [this](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/docker-toolbox/) before installing.
 - AWS Account
     - You can create an AWS account by signing up [here](https://aws.amazon.com/#).
- AWS, EKSCTL and KUBECTL CLI

## Project Steps
### Run the API Locally using the Flask Server
- Install python dependencies: These dependencies are kept in a `requirements.txt` file in the root directory of the repository. To install them, go to the project directory and run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

- Set up the environment: You do not need to create an `.env_file` file to run locally but you do need two variables available in your terminal environment:
    - JWT_SECRET - The secret used to make the JWT, for the purpose of this course the secret can be any string.
    - LOG_LEVEL - It represents the level of logging. It is optional to be set. It has a default value as 'INFO', but when debugging an app locally, you may want to set it to 'DEBUG'.

    To add these to your terminal environment, run the following:
    ```
    export JWT_SECRET='myjwtsecret'
    export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
    echo $JWT_SECRET
    echo $LOG_LEVEL
    ```
- Run the app: Run the app using the Flask server, from the root directory of the downloaded repository, run `python main.py`. Open http://127.0.0.1:8080/ in a new browser OR run `curl --request GET http://localhost:8080/` on the command-line terminal. It will give you a response as "Healthy".

- Install a command-line JSON processor: Before trying to access other endpoints of the app, we need the jq, a package that helps to pretty-print JSON outputs. In simple words, the JQ package helps you parse, filter, or modify JSON outputs. Open a new terminal window, and run the command below. For Linux, run `sudo apt-get install jq`. For Mac, run `brew install jq`. For Windows, run `chocolatey install jq`.

- Access endpoint /auth
To try the /auth endpoint, use the following command, replacing email/password as applicable to you 
    ```
    export TOKEN=`curl --data '{"email":"abc@xyz.com","password":"mypwd"}' --header "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST localhost:8080/auth  | jq -r '.token'`
    ```
    This calls the endpoint 'localhost:8080/auth' with the email/password as the message body. The return value is a JWT token based on the secret string you supplied. We are assigning that secret to the environment variable 'TOKEN'. To see the JWT token, run `echo $TOKEN`.

- Access endpoint /contents: To try the /contents endpoint which decrypts the token and returns its content, run `curl --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/contents' -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" | jq .` You should see the email id that you passed in as one of the values.

### Containerize the Flask App and Run Locally

- Prerequisite - Docker Desktop: If you haven't installed Docker already, you should install now using [these installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

- Storing Environment variables: Create a file named .env_file and save both JWT_SECRET and LOG_LEVEL into .env_file. This .env_file is only for the purposes of running the container locally, you do not want to push it into the Github or other public repositories. You can prevent this by adding it to your .gitignore file, which will cause git to ignore it. To safely store and use secrets in the cloud, use a secure solution such as AWS’s parameter store.

- Build an image: Build a local Docker image, by running the commands below from the directory where your Dockerfile resides.
    ```
    docker build -t myimage .
    # Check the list of images
    docker image ls
    # Remove any image
    docker image rm <image_id>
    ```
- Create and run a container by running:
    ```
    docker run --name myContainer --env-file=.env_file -p 80:8080 myimage

    # List running containers
    docker container ls
    docker ps
    # Stop a container
    docker container stop <container_id>
    # Remove a container
    docker container rm <container_id>
    ```
- Check the endpoints: To use the endpoints, you can use the same curl commands as before, except using port 80 this time. Open a new terminal window, and try the following command:
    ```
    # Flask server running inside a container
    curl --request GET 'http://localhost:80/'

    # Flask server running locally (only the port number is different)
    curl --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/'

    # Calls the endpoint 'localhost:80/auth' with the email/password as the message body. 
    # The return JWT token assigned to the environment variable 'TOKEN' 
    export TOKEN=`curl --data '{"email":"abc@gmail.com","password":"password"}' --header "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST localhost:80/auth  | jq -r '.token'`
    echo $TOKEN

    # Decrypt the token and returns its content
    curl --request GET 'http://localhost:80/contents' -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" | jq .
    ```
### Create an EKS Cluster and IAM Role
1. Create an EKS (Kubernetes) Cluster
    - Create an EKS cluster named “simple-jwt-api” in a region of your choice:
        ```
        # Create cluster in the default region
        eksctl create cluster --name simple-jwt-api
        # Create a cluster in a specific region, such as us-east-2
        eksctl create cluster --name simple-jwt-api --region=us-east-2
        ```
    - Verify: You can go to the CloudFormation or EKS web-console to view the progress. If you don’t see any progress, be sure that you are viewing clusters in the same region that they are being created. Once the status is CREATE_COMPLETE in your command line, check the health of your clusters nodes `kubectl get nodes`.

    - Delete by running `eksctl delete cluster simple-jwt-api  --region=<REGION>`

2. Create an IAM Role
    - Get your AWS account id by running `aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text`.

    - Create a trust relationship. To do this, create a blank trust.json file, add the following content to it and replace the <ACCOUNT_ID> with your actual account Id. This policy file defines the actions allowed by whosoever assumes the new Role.
        ```
        {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
                {
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Principal": {
                        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:root"
                    },
                    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
                }
            ]
        }
        ```
    - Create a role, 'FlaskDeployCBKubectlRole', using the trust.json trust relationship:
        ```
        aws iam create-role --role-name FlaskDeployCBKubectlRole --assume-role-policy-document file://trust.json --output text --query 'Role.Arn'
        ```
    - Create a policy document, `iam-role-policy.json`, that allows (whosoever assumes the role) to perform specific actions (permissions) - "eks:Describe*" and "ssm:GetParameters" as:
        ```
        {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement":[{
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": ["eks:Describe*", "ssm:GetParameters"],
                "Resource":"*"
            }]
        }
        ```
    - Attach the iam-role-policy.json policy to the 'FlaskDeployCBKubectlRole' by running:
        ```
        aws iam put-role-policy --role-name FlaskDeployCBKubectlRole --policy-name eks-describe --policy-document file://iam-role-policy.json
        ```
    - Verify the newly created role in the IAM service
3. Allowing the new role access to the cluster: Before you assign the new-role to the CodeBuild service (so that CodeBuild can also administer the cluster) you will have to add an entry of this new role into the 'aws-auth ConfigMap'. The aws-auth ConfigMap is used to grant role-based access control to your cluster. When your cluster is first created, the user who created it is given sole permission to administer it. Therefore, to grant any AWS service/user who will assume this role the ability to interact with your cluster, you must edit the 'aws-auth ConfigMap' within Kubernetes.

    - Fetch: Get the current configmap and save it to a file:
        ```
        # Mac/Linux
        # The file will be created at `/System/Volumes/Data/private/tmp/aws-auth-patch.yml` path

        kubectl get -n kube-system configmap/aws-auth -o yaml > /tmp/aws-auth-patch.yml

        # Windows 
        # The file will be created in the current working directory

        kubectl get -n kube-system configmap/aws-auth -o yaml > aws-auth-patch.yml
        ```
    - Edit: Open the aws-auth-patch.yml file using any editor, such as VS code editor:
        ```
        # Mac/Linux
        code /System/Volumes/Data/private/tmp/aws-auth-patch.yml
        # Windows
        code aws-auth-patch.yml
        ```
        Add the following group in the data → mapRoles section of this file. YAML is indentation-sensitive, therefore refer to the snapshot below for a correct indentation:
        ```
        mapRoles: |
            - groups:
            - system:masters
            rolearn: arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:role/FlaskDeployCBKubectlRole
            username: build      
        ```

    - Update: Update your cluster's configmap:
        ```
        # Mac/Linux
        kubectl patch configmap/aws-auth -n kube-system --patch "$(cat /tmp/aws-auth-patch.yml)"

        # Windows
        kubectl patch configmap/aws-auth -n kube-system --patch "$(cat aws-auth-patch.yml)"
        ```
        The command above must show you `configmap/aws-auth patched` as a response.

### Deployment to Kubernetes using CodePipeline and CodeBuild

1. Generate a Github access token: A Github access token will allow CodePipeline to monitor when a repo is changed. A token can be generated [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/). You should generate the token with full control of repositories. Be sure to save the token somewhere that is secure.

    Once you create a personal access token, you can share this with any service (such as AWS CodeBuild, or AWS CLI) to allow accessing the repositories under your Github account.
2. Create a pipeline using CloudFormation template

    - Modify the template: open `ci-cd-codepipeline.cfn.yml` and go to the 'Parameters' section. These are parameters that will accept values when you create a stack. Fill in the value for the following parameters:

        | Parameter       	| Field   	| Possible Value                                            	|
        |-----------------	|---------	|-----------------------------------------------------------	|
        | EksClusterName  	| Default 	| simple-jwt-api                                            	|
        | GitSourceRepo   	| Default 	| Deploying-a-Flask-App-to-Kubernetes-with-a-CI-CD-pipeline 	|
        | GitBranch       	| Default 	| main                                                      	|
        | GitHubUser      	| Default 	| Your Github username                                      	|
        | KubectlRoleName 	| Default 	| FlaskDeployCBKubectlRole                                  	|

    - Create Stack
    Use the AWS web-console to create a stack for CodePipeline using the CloudFormation template file `ci-cd-codepipeline.cfn.yml`. Go to the CloudFormation service in the AWS console. Press the Create Stack button. It will make you go through the following three steps:

        Step 1. Specify template - Choose the options "Template is ready" and "Upload a template file" to upload the template file ci-cd-codepipeline.cfn.yml. Click the 'Next' button.

        Step 2. Specify stack details - Give the stack a name, fill in your GitHub login, and the Github access token generated in the previous step. Make sure that the cluster name matches the one you have created, and the 'kubectl IAM role' matches the role you created above, and the repository matches the name of your forked repo.

        Step 3. Configure stack options - Leave default, and create the stack.

        Troubleshoot: If there is an indentation error in your YAML template file, the CloudFormation will raise a "Template format error". In such a case, you will have to identify the line of error in the template, using any external tools, such as - YAML Validator or YAML Lint.

        You can check its status in the CloudFormation console. It will take some time (5-15 mins) to create the stack. After the successful creation of the stack, you can see the CodeBuild project and CodePipeline instance get automatically created for you. In addition, the Cloudformation template will create a few more resources, such as an S3 bucket, a Lambda function, and others.

3. Set a Secret using AWS Parameter Store

    We need a way to pass your JWT secret to the app in kubernetes securly. You will be using AWS Parameter Store to do this.

    Add the following to the end of the buildspec.yml file (be careful about the indentation). This lets CodeBuild know to set an environment variable based on a value in the parameter-store. 
    ```
    env:
        parameter-store:         
        JWT_SECRET: JWT_SECRET
    ```
    Put secret into AWS Parameter Store
    ```
    aws ssm put-parameter --name JWT_SECRET --overwrite --value "YourJWTSecret" --type SecureString
    ```
    You can delete the variable from parameter-store using:
    ```
    aws ssm delete-parameter --name JWT_SECRET
    ```
4. CodeBuild
    In the previous step, the CloudFormation template file, ci-cd-codepipeline.cfn.yml, will automatically create a CodeBuild project. By default, the build process depends on the buildspec.yml file.

    - buildspec.yml: The CodeBuild expects the build specification in a file named buildspec.yml (default name) to run a build. This file must be placed in the root of your source directory (Github repo). The buildspec.yml is a collection of build commands and related settings, in YAML format.

        Note - In the buildspec.yml file, use the same (or closer) KUBECTL version as you've used while creating an EKS cluster (run kubectl version in your local terminal). To do so, uncomment and replace this line in the buildspec.yml with a specific version of your choice. Refer to the Install kubectl on Linux worker nodes for the available versions. (Mind the region in your URL too).

    - Details of the buildspec.yml: The buildspec.yml file specifies the different phases of a build, such as an install, pre-build, build, and post-build. Each phase has a set of commands to be automatically executed by CodeBuild. When you trigger a build in the CodeBuild, you can see each command being executed in the CodeBuild log console.

    - Trigger: Start the build process by clicking on the “Start build” button in the CodeBuild dashboard.

5. Test the stack and API endpoints.
    To check if the pipeline works, commit a change to the master branch of your Github repo. In the AWS console go to the CodePipeline dashboard. You should see that the build is running.
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m “my comment“
    git push
    ```

    To test your API endpoints, get the external IP for your service by running `kubectl get services simple-jwt-api -o wide`.

    Use the external IP url to test the app:
    ```
    export TOKEN=`curl -d '{"email":"<EMAIL>","password":"<PASSWORD>"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST <EXTERNAL-IP URL>/auth  | jq -r '.token'`

    curl --request GET '<EXTERNAL-IP URL>/contents' -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" | jq 
    ```
